Small project created while studying NoSQL -> MongoDB - ToDo List WebApp.
You can use standard list for "Today" our create your own.
I was using HTML, CSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas. App was deployed to Heroku.
It's v1.0, because user interface still has to be improved.
